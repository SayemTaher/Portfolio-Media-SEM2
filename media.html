                    <p><span>Requirements: </span>In three blocks of activities you will develop and refine your 
                        skills in the area of 
                        Online Imagery and Photography, Print Media and Video Production.</p>
                    <p class="media-objectives">The Media Production course includes gaining hands-on 
                        experience with Adobe Illustrator to create logos and posters, Adobe Indesign 
                        to create awesome layout designs, and Media Encoder to edit videos. During the
                        development process of Media Production we will be introduced with Film 
                        Production & Photography.
                        This portfolio will showcase products that have already been developed or are 
                        in the process of development.In this page I will show my latest products that I worked on and what 
                        I learned while working on those products and how my teachers feedback helped me to 
                        grow continiously and achieve the expected result.

                        <p><span>Description: </span>During this development process we were introduced 
                        with our first task Logo designing. During this challenge my Media Production teacher 
                        asked us to think about our favourite color, to think about a brand that can grow faster 
                        around us which also can be our own brand also to think about the logo that we choose and show reason 
                        for choosing the logo or the designing and the thought process. It was one of the most interesting thing 
                        for me because I always had this idea to establish mens clothing brand by my own name but never think 
                        of how m,y brand logo should look like.Because the name of the brand and the logo of a clothing brand can make a big difference in attracting customers and making them think about the brand in the first place.
                        I went through several iterations and considered numerous options. Because 
                        it's my own name and it's only for men's clothing, I chose the word MAN and 
                        adjusted it with my name, which fortunately matches the rest of the brand 
                        name. During this process, I  showed my logo to a couple of my friends 
                        to get their feedback on it, such as whether it looks cheap, whether the 
                        colors match well, and whether it looks trustworthy, as well as how the 
                        brand name sounds.</p>

                        <p><span>Feedback: </span>After completing my first iterations, I approached 
                            my teacher for feedback. He liked the idea and the logo, but he pointed 
                            out a few flaws, such as the conflicts between the logo and the brand 
                            name below it, which are a little larger and cause problems for users
                             when they try to focus on the logo. Second, I used a gradient to give
                              it a vibrant color, which was uninspired because the color I used 
                              loses contrast in low light and appears black. Third, I used the 
                              first and last letter of my brand name as the logo, which he said 
                              didn't work and was uninspired. Instead, he suggested that I use 
                              something that represents two words. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="logo-outcomes">
                        <p><span>Learning Outcomes: </span> During this logo designing task I was surprised to understand how a simple and small thing can create a  great influence in the experience of users and why designers should work  on this carefully to select the design and everything that goes with it.
                                    In my third iteration, I changed the color to completely black, reduced the font size for my brand name, used the letter S for my own name, and replaced the previously entered symbol N with M, which represents the short form of MAN.
                                    This task enabled me to have more control over my thinking and idea generation while working on a logo.</p>

                    course in photography basics and Adobe Indesign to get us started with the program so that we could design our own
                    photography portfolio in the style of a magazine. During the photography training, we were handed a single lens camera
                    to capture our finest snap. We experimented with several camera modes to discover why snapping a picture should tell us
                    a story in and of itself, and how we might do it without explaining anything.The course also provided 
                    us a briefed information about different ways of capturing a photo and what we should consider to do so.

                        Our team took on the exciting challenge of creating our own documentary. As 
                        a group of four, we decided to tackle the housing crisis in The Netherlands as our subject.
                         We explored the streets of Eindhoven, capturing footage that depicted the realities and 
                         emotions surrounding this issue. Combining our individual shots, we crafted a cohesive 
                         narrative and added a compelling voiceover. This experience was not only academically 
                         rewarding but also allowed us to understand the power of visual storytelling and its potential 
                         to inspire change. Ultimately, our documentary aimed to inform, educate, and spark conversations
                          about the housing crisis while encouraging viewers to take action.
