              <p><span>Task: </span> The first task assigned to us was to design the landing page for the <b>Aircomapny</b>. 
                It's a simple design that allows students to experiment with different ways of creating a navigation bar
                 while the end result should remain consistent. Students will also learn how to add icons beside the tab
                  title and how to use a gradient background on a button in this challenge. I created the nav bar with 
                  CSS Flexbox, which allowed me to give the navigation the proper shape. Though I couldn't find the right
                   video to add to the homepage's main section, I used  similar gradient, so it may appear similar.</p>
              <p class="learning-outcome"><span>Learning Outcome:</span>
               While working on this challenge, I discovered new ways to design navigation bars. Despite the fact that
                I had a lot of experience with this type of layout, it was a little easier for me. When I first saw the
                 structure, I knew exactly how I should approach it. This assignment assisted me in reviewing my previous
                  CSS knowledge.</p>

            <p><span>Task: </span> We had to generate an image while clicking on any part of a webpage during this challenge. 
              It was the first challenge where we were advised to use JavaScript to achieve the desired result using an
               event handler. The first step was to generate an image by clicking on a button. Later, my teacher advised 
               us to take it a step further and generate an image by clicking. Essentially, it was intended to test our 
               understanding of how the click event works on a webpage.
            </p>
            <p class="learning-outcome"><span>Learning Outcome:</span>
             It was a unique challenge. Working on this challenge helped me better understand how a webpage's click event works. It was our first assignment in which we used JavaScript.
              It's intriguing that using JS, you can do anything and manipulate the structure of a webpage.
              Rather than focusing solely on achieving the goal, my goal for this challenge was to understand the behavior of JavaScript. Finally, this assignment taught me how to work with image loading and click events.</p>

            <p><span>Task: </span> During this challenge, we practiced changing layouts while working with only one HTML file.
               This was by far one of my favorite assignments. The assignment was difficult because it was the first time 
               I worked on a single HTMl file while creating layouts for multiple webpages. We were permitted to use multiple 
               CSS files as well as JavaScript to change the layout when clicking on the navigation bar. I completed the 
               assignment while in class and asked my Development teacher for feedback.

              But I had a great time and learned a lot about working with websites. Also, each time I clicked on a
               different navbar, I had to change the CSS file. During that time, I learned different ways to work
                with JS and how to achieve the desired result. Overall, I was pleased that I could do it; it was 
                both challenging and interesting.

            <p><span>Description: </span>We were assigned the task of experimenting with different ways of working with CSS animation on our portfolio website.
            We were able to use fantastic animation on our website to give it a more cool feeling this way. Any user's entire
            website experience can be improved by animation. On my portfolio, I used several animations such as typewriter
            animation, wave animation, and image 3D carousel. The one I loved most was the 3D image carousel, which I used on my
            landing page. </p>

              on YouTube, I wanted to incorporate it into my portfolio. To me, it appears quite nice to slide over different graphics
              to make the page more engaging. For each label to trigger when checked, I had to use multiple <span> label & id's
              </span>. When a label is checked based on its position, I used <span> transform:translate3D() </span> to adjust the
              position of the card. This is how I accomplished three-dimensional transformation as you can see in the code excerpt,
              different values are returned each time a label is checked.

              that can be achieved using simply CSS. This assignment assisted me in understanding and going over my prior
              implementations to determine the WHY. </p>

            <p><span>Learning Outcomes:</span> This final assignment was significant for me as I just started learning how to work with 
              arrays, objects, DOM manipulation, JSON and how to save data on localstorage and retrieve it. It was both challenging and  
              at the same time interesting for me as it took me some time to complete the whole assignment.

          <p> This semester has been a captivating journey for me, filled with interesting, challenging, and enjoyable experiences.
             When it comes to development, I primarily dedicated my time to self-learning. Understanding the fundamental concepts 
             played a vital role in my progress, and I continue to expand my knowledge as I strive to develop new and innovative

             for my growth. They not only sparked my curiosity but also presented me with challenges that pushed me to explore and
              navigate the vast expanse of the web in search of viable solutions. This process of problem-solving and overcoming
