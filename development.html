          <p class="intro-explained">To meet the requirements, this section will offer a comprehensive overview
             of the challenges I tackled, my methods for completing them,

               Furthermore, I will detail the various approaches I utilized

              <h1>Challenge One: <span> Landing Page of <a href="https://www.aircompany.com/">Aircompany.com</a></span></h1>
              <p><span>Task: </span> The first task assigned to us was to design the landing page for the <b>Aircomapny</b>. 
                It's a simple design that allows students to experiment with different ways of creating a navigation bar
                 while the end result should remain consistent. Students will also learn how to add icons beside the tab
                  title and how to use a gradient background on a button in this challenge. I created the nav bar with 
                  CSS Flexbox, which allowed me to give the navigation the proper shape. Though I couldn't find the right
                   video to add to the homepage's main section, I used  similar gradient, so it may appear similar.</p>
              <p class="learning-outcome"><span>Learning Outcome:</span>
               While working on this challenge, I discovered new ways to design navigation bars. Despite the fact that
                I had a lot of experience with this type of layout, it was a little easier for me. When I first saw the
                 structure, I knew exactly how I should approach it. This assignment assisted me in reviewing my previous
                  CSS knowledge.</p>

            <h1>Challenge Two: <span>Generate Image On Click</span></h1>
            <p><span>Task: </span> We had to generate an image while clicking on any part of a webpage during this challenge. 
              It was the first challenge where we were advised to use JavaScript to achieve the desired result using an
               event handler. The first step was to generate an image by clicking on a button. Later, my teacher advised 
               us to take it a step further and generate an image by clicking. Essentially, it was intended to test our 
               understanding of how the click event works on a webpage.
            </p>
            <p class="learning-outcome"><span>Learning Outcome:</span>
             It was a unique challenge. Working on this challenge helped me better understand how a webpage's click event works. It was our first assignment in which we used JavaScript.
              It's intriguing that using JS, you can do anything and manipulate the structure of a webpage.
              Rather than focusing solely on achieving the goal, my goal for this challenge was to understand the behavior of JavaScript. Finally, this assignment taught me how to work with image loading and click events.</p>

            <h1>Challenge Three: <span>One HTML different Layout</span></h1>
            <p><span>Task: </span> During this challenge, we practiced changing layouts while working with only one HTML file.
               This was by far one of my favorite assignments. The assignment was difficult because it was the first time 
               I worked on a single HTMl file while creating layouts for multiple webpages. We were permitted to use multiple 
               CSS files as well as JavaScript to change the layout when clicking on the navigation bar. I completed the 
               assignment while in class and asked my Development teacher for feedback.

               During the discussion, my teacher expressed her appreciation for my work and assisted me in understanding
                how I should include the assignment in my portfolio for grading.
            </p>
            <p class="learning-outcome">
              <span>Learning Outcome: </span> It was my first challenge in which I had to work with a single HTML file. 
              But I had a great time and learned a lot about working with websites. Also, each time I clicked on a
               different navbar, I had to change the CSS file. During that time, I learned different ways to work
                with JS and how to achieve the desired result. Overall, I was pleased that I could do it; it was 
                both challenging and interesting.
