                <p>On this page, I will share my journey of creating a new 
                portfolio for this semester. I will reflect on my thought
                process and explain how I was able to deliver a portfolio
                that is different from my previous one.</p>

                <h1>Thought Process </h1>
                <p>Since the beginning of this semester, I had a clear vision of
                doing something different with my portfolio. My main focus 
                was on incorporating animations and enhancing the user 
                experience on my site. A quick comparison with my previous
                portfolio reveals distinct changes in the header, navigation
                bar, and overall simplicity of the homepage.
                For this semester, I dedicated my efforts to improving colour 
                contrast, navigation, and accessibility, aiming to create a 
                pleasant user experience during site exploration. Not only did 
                I want to showcase my work, but I also wanted users to enjoy 
                their time on the site. This led me to develop a completely 
                different footer navigation bar and implement various working 
                and captivating animations, ultimately elevating the overall 
                user experience.</p>
            </div>

                <div class="pre-title">
                    <h1>Previous <span>Portfolio</span> </h1>
                    <p>When you explore this site, you will immediately notice the
                        significant changes. The previous portfolio had a 
                        deliberate simplicity, designed to serve its purpose 
                        effectively. One notable feature of the previous portfolio
                        was its compatibility with various devices, ensuring a 
                        seamless user experience. However, with the new portfolio,
                        things have evolved significantly.</p>

            <div class="latest-first-proto">
                <div class="latest-first-img">
                    <img src="/Images/prototype1 .png" alt="">
                </div>
                <div class="latest-first-header">
                    <h1>New Idea's or <span>inspiration?</span> </h1>
                    <p>The core inspiration for this design came from the layout 
                    of Facebook pages. I aimed to create something similar yet
                    unique to my own style. The homepage, in particular, 
                    underwent several iterations over a significant period 
                    of time, as I continuously made changes to enhance its 
                    visual appeal. The addition of an About section and the 
                    inclusion of a photography option in the latest iterations
                    do bear some resemblance to a Facebook page, further 
                    adding to its uniqueness.</p>

            <div class="latest-last-proto">
                <div class="latest-last-header">
                    <h1>Latest <span> Version</span></h1>
                    <p>Personally, I find the navigation bar in my current 
                        portfolio to be exceptionally cool. Although it might 
                        be biased for me to appreciate my own work, I can't 
                        help but acknowledge a unique aspect of this navigation 
                        bar. Its versatility stands out as a noteworthy feature.
                        I have designed it in such a way that it can be easily 
                        modified and adapted for almost any device, which adds 
                        a significant level of convenience and flexibility. For the final 
                        version of my portfolio I have worked with the fonts. I increased the 
                        weight of the font for some cases which significantly enhanced the overall 
                        outlook of the pages. For instance the texts on the front page is now 
                        catches attention faster also I have replaced the github icon on the header with  
                        my brand name that I created for Media Production </p>

            <div class="lo-and-feed-proto">
                <p><span>Feedback: </span>I received tremendous appreciation for 
                    the layout, design, and overall structure of this portfolio, 
                    particularly from my UCD, Media Production, and Development 
                    teacher. In order to gauge the experience of exploring my 
                    portfolio, I sought feedback from both my group mates and 
                    friends from other classes. The response was overwhelmingly 
                    positive, with the site earning high praise from nearly 
                    everyone who visited it. </p>
                <p><span>Learning Outcomes: </span> During this semester I have learned and practiced a 
                lot to enhance the design of my portfolio to try out different things. Yet this will never 
                end here. Even though I believe the latest design will serve it's purpose I hope to  
                work on different other things for instance more interactive yet useful animation implementation . 
                last semester I worked with web responsiveness and this semester I worked with animation and the 
                UI . I am eagerly waiting to develop my next portfolio website where I will use 
                JavaScript and CSS framework to widely chnage the User Interface and User Experience on my site in the upcoming semester. Yes, that's my next objective.</p>
