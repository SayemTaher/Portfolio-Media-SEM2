        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p><span>Requirements:</span> You will develop a brand and website for a real client. Project groups will pitch their ideas to the client, the best work will be selected as their new identity on the web. </p>
        <p class="project-intro-overview"><span> Introduction to the Project:</span> During the first week
           of semester two, we were introduced to our group project, on which we will 
           collaborate for the remainder of the semester. We met our client <span> Erion Kapaj</span> ,
            a Greek artist.
        During this semester, we will work on creating a professional platform for our
         client where he can display his artwork and personal life, as well as offer 
         users the option to purchase his work if they so desire. The project requires
          multiple challenges to overcome as a group, including developing a proper
           <span> Team Agreement, Project Plan, Survey, Interview, User Research, Prototype</span> ,
            which will lead to <span> implementation</span> , and finally <span> Product Testing</span> . This page
             will provide a comprehensive overview of our approach to delivering the 
             final product and how I collaborated with  my fellow teammates to make it happen.

              <h1><span>Step One:</span> Team Agreement</h1>
              <p>As our first step, we formed a group of six people and named it Homodeus.
                 Even though everyone is committed to actively working together, we wanted 
                 to follow certain terms and conditions that were specifically designed for
                 our group. In this regard, we established a group agreement with everyone's
                  consent for each and every rule. We discussed how to avoid risks Â as well 
                  as how to deal with or prevent them from occurring. This is one of the 
                  first pieces of work we completed for the group project during the first 
                  week.</p>

              <h1><span>Step Two:</span> Project Plan</h1>
              <p>Our second task was to develop a proper project plan. It took us some time
                 to research the problem and identify relevant topics that could assist us 
                 in completing this project. Here we described the project's goal, problem 
                 statement, roles, scope, risk assessment, and current status.
              The project plan provided us with specific ideas for how we should proceed.
              We mentioned our research topic and any questions we might have while 
              conducting research on our client. This document provides a clear overview 
              of our project structure.</p>

              <h1><span>Step Three:</span> Survey</h1>
              <p>We had to go through multiple challenges as planned to figure out the
                 majority of the outcome. We need real-life data for this, so we organized 
                 our questions and discussed our ideas with our clients, as well as our 
                 questions, so that we could offer him the expected outcome as a product.
                  Following that, we launched our Survey for people who are interested in
                   purchasing or learning more about art and artists. This gradually leads
                    us to our user interviews and expert interviews, which will help us
                     create a proper user research based on the data we will receive and
                      then extract the most important thing, which is user requirements.</p>
