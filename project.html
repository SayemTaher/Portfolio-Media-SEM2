        <p><span>Requirements:</span> You will develop a brand and website for a real client. Project groups will pitch their ideas to the client, the best work will be selected as their new identity on the web. </p>
        <p class="project-intro-overview"><span> Introduction to the Project:</span> During the first week
           of semester two, we were introduced to our group project, on which we will 
           collaborate for the remainder of the semester. We met our client <span> Erion Kapaj</span> ,
            a Greek artist.
        During this semester, we will work on creating a professional platform for our
         client where he can display his artwork and personal life, as well as offer 
         users the option to purchase his work if they so desire. The project requires
          multiple challenges to overcome as a group, including developing a proper
           <span> Team Agreement, Project Plan, Survey, Interview, User Research, Prototype</span> ,
            which will lead to <span> implementation</span> , and finally <span> Product Testing</span> . This page
             will provide a comprehensive overview of our approach to delivering the 
             final product and how I collaborated with  my fellow teammates to make it happen.

              <h1><span>Step One:</span> Team Agreement</h1>
              <p>As our first step, we formed a group of six people and named it Homodeus.
                 Even though everyone is committed to actively working together, we wanted 
                 to follow certain terms and conditions that were specifically designed for
                 our group. In this regard, we established a group agreement with everyone's
                  consent for each and every rule. We discussed how to avoid risks Â as well 
                  as how to deal with or prevent them from occurring. This is one of the 
                  first pieces of work we completed for the group project during the first 
                  week.</p>

              <p>Our second task was to develop a proper project plan. It took us some time
                 to research the problem and identify relevant topics that could assist us 
                 in completing this project. Here we described the project's goal, problem 
                 statement, roles, scope, risk assessment, and current status.
              The project plan provided us with specific ideas for how we should proceed.
              We mentioned our research topic and any questions we might have while 
              conducting research on our client. This document provides a clear overview

              <p>We had to go through multiple challenges as planned to figure out the
                majority of the outcome. We need real-life data for this, so we organized 
                our questions and discussed our ideas with our clients, as well as our 
                questions, so that we could offer him the expected outcome as a product.
                Following that, we launched our Survey for people who are interested in
                purchasing or learning more about art and artists. This gradually leads
                us to our user interviews and expert interviews, which will help us
                create a proper user research based on the data we will receive and
                then extract the most important thing, which is user requirements.</p>

                            code and placed it in numerous areas to reach a varied variety of consumers. We opted to publish the QR code
                            in an art gallery here in Eindhoven because we are working for an artist. This enabled us to collect 
                            information from people who commonly visit art galleries or attend art exhibitions. We received 20 responses
                            from consumers in all, which provided us with useful insights into their requirements and expectations.

                            real life , the gestures and expression and how people show
                            body language while providing feedback to certain things.
                            Additionally, <span>I performed a heuristic evaluation to identify
                            any potential usability issues.</span>  By collecting this feedback,
                            we were able to pinpoint the necessary changes to improve 
                            our portfolio and ensure that the website effectively serves
                            its intended purpose.</p>

                            incorporate user suggestions, optimising the interface for easy

                Over the past 18 weeks, I had the incredible opportunity to collaborate with a remarkable and responsible team.
                Throughout this time, I took on various roles and responsibilities, working closely with my teammates to fulfill
                the project's objectives. From conducting surveys and interviews to understanding user requirements and designing 
                the final interface, the journey of the past 18 months has been both long and impactful. It has allowed me to grow
                personally, enhancing my skills in research, listening, and self-improvement as a professional. Despite the 
                challenges our team faced, I remained committed to maintaining a consistent workflow and motivating my teammates
                to progress and flourish together. Working with real clients further provided me with insights into the real 
                world and helped me understand human expectations, enabling me to create something useful and effective. This
                semester has pushed me to strive for excellence and continuous learning in all aspects. I eagerly anticipate
                more challenges ahead as I wholeheartedly dedicate myself to my upcoming tasks.
