                    <h1>My objective as a User Centered Designer</h1>
                    <p>During my learning period of User-Centered Design, I've realized that user-friendliness and accessibility play 
                        a crucial role in developing successful websites. They are essential to ensuring users have a satisfactory 
                        experience. As a future user-centered designer, my main priority will be creating products that are easy for
                         users to use and accessible to all. Users are the most important factor in any product, and it is crucial 
                         to consider their perspective. If a developer builds a product only from their point of view, users may 
                         find it difficult to control or navigate, which can lead to negative outcomes for the company. It can take 
                         years to develop a product, but it should be structured to serve the users. Therefore, my main focus will
                          be on maximizing user experience, ensuring maximum accessibility and friendliness, and developing applications 
                          that are easy to navigate.

                            websites based on user-centered design. The evaluation criteria were based on factors such 
                            as accessibility, user experience, design, structure, and navigation, with the aim of 
                            assessing whether each website fulfills its intended purpose effectively. The main purpose 
                            of the assignment was to identify differences between the websites and understand what makes 
                            some websites more user-friendly than others. Ultimately, the goal was to distinguish three 
                            websites with good user-centered design from three websites with poor user-centered design.</p>

                            <p><span>Airbnb: </span> Based on my research, the first website that stands out to me as
                                 having good user-centered design is Airbnb's website. The website serves the commercial
                                  purpose of allowing users to browse different housing options for temporary residence.
                                   I found that the website effectively serves its intended purpose, with the homepage 
                                   featuring a clear and organized display of various housing options to capture users'
                                    attention. The navigation bars are also well-structured and designed for easy user 
                                    searchability. Overall, I believe that Airbnb's website is an excellent example of
                                     user-centered design, and as a user myself, I found it to be a positive user 
                                     experience.</p>

                                their commitment to serving their users is reflected in the design of their website. Apple 
                                invests millions of dollars to ensure that their users have the best possible experience 
                                when browsing their products on their website. Their animations and navigation systems are
                                 impressive and capable of capturing the attention of almost any customer or potential 
                                 customer. Apple has been successful in delivering a positive user experience for years,
                                  and I believe that their website is an excellent example of effective user-centered

                            design is reflected in their website's user-friendly navigation system, which makes it easy for 
                            users to find whatever they are looking for. Additionally, Amazon provides relevant advertisements
                             for other products based on a user's search history, which helps users discover other items that
                              may be of interest to them. The website is also designed to be very user-friendly, with detailed

                            of poor user-centered design. The website is cluttered, making it difficult to find 
                            information while navigating. As a service system, customers primarily seek to 
                            track their orders, yet the website provides only a small input box for entering 
                            order details, while focusing on irrelevant content. When accessing the website,
                            it took me some time to locate the tracking feature. Additionally, the navigation 
                            portal is overloaded with unnecessary information, which may cause frustration for
                             users seeking specific information. Although the website functions as intended, 
                             its poor design detracts from the user experience, making it a negative example

                                  due to the difficulty of locating the relevant options. The platform crams 
                                  too many features onto a single page, resulting in a cluttered and 
                                  overwhelming experience for users. Unfortunately, this has become one 
                                  of my prime examples of a poorly designed application that hinders the

                             with too much information. As a user, I struggle to find the information I need in the
                              navigation bar, and the interface lacks a clean and structured design, leading to a poor

                    <p><span>Description: </span>The goal of this assignment was to thoroughly research Coca Cola's 
                        marketing strategy, focusing on how they became the world's most successful soft drink company.
                         We looked at how they executed their strategy to reach every corner of the world, from the 
                         richest cities to the most rural villages. Our analysis also included how they've managed 
                         to stay ahead of other brands selling similar products. We found that Coca Cola's strategy 
                         is based on three main criteria: segmentation, targeting, and positioning, which have been 
                         crucial to their ongoing success since the company began.</p>

                        <p><span>Segmentation: </span>Coca Cola's segmentation strategy was a game changer for the company,
                             propelling them to success. Instead of limiting their reach to big cities, Coca Cola went to great 
                             lengths to distribute their product worldwide. By studying the market of each region, they were 
                             able to tailor their product to suit the interests of the local people, which allowed them to 
                             dominate the market wherever they went. Additionally, Coca Cola maintained a high standard for
                              their product, setting them apart from competitors. They implemented a balanced marketing 
                              strategy that included advertising, using celebrities and campaigns, and even giving away 
                              free samples to study the market and customers. Their use of big names in advertising helped
                               to build trust with local people, and their commitment to providing an energy boost while 
                               maintaining good health made Coca Cola a popular choice.</p>

                        <p><span>Targeting: </span> Coca Cola's customer targeting strategy has been another vital factor in 
                            the success of the brand. They have targeted customers ranging from young boys aged 10 to 25 to 
                            adults aged 25 to 40, by studying their interests and providing products with different tastes 
                            to meet their satisfaction. For customers with heart disease and obesity problems, Coca Cola 
                            produced Cola Zero, which contains only a small amount of artificial sugar while providing the
                             same taste but with a milder flavor. In addition to this, Coca Cola introduced other products
                              such as Sprite, which has also gained customer preference. By providing a variety of products 
                              and targeting different age groups, Coca Cola ensured that they did not lose their hold on the market.

                            video advertisements featuring people drinking Coca-Cola and experiencing instant refreshment. Their marketing 
                            techniques position Coca-Cola as the drink of choice for fun occasions with friends and family, tired travelers,
                             and people looking to relax on a hot day. Furthermore, Coca-Cola has positioned itself as a premium-quality drink, making it a top choice among consumers.

                              to mind. This positioning strategy has made Coca-Cola an attractive option for anyone seeking to indulge in 
                              life's pleasures.</p>

                    <h1><span>Task Three:</span>  Research on The Principles of Psychology in UX</h1>
                    <p><span>Description: </span>We were assigned to conduct research on psychological aspects of user experience. This includes different ways of structuring the website that provide psychological peace to any user while also making the user experience smooth and accessible.
                    There are a total of nine principles of  psychological aspects in UX that 
                    can significantly improve user experience. These include the Principle of
                     Least Effort, Perpetual Habit, Socialisation, Emotional Contagion, 
                     Identity, Beauty, The Magical Number Seven, Mistakes and Focus, and 
                     Attention & Concentration. Below, I will explain my findings on various 
                     websites that correspond to the principles of Psychology in UX.</p>

                <div class="least-effort-and-beauty">
                    <p><span>Least Effort & Beauty: </span>While considering the design aspects of
                         a website, there are numerous websites that can be the perfect match in
                          terms of least effort and beauty, but for me, I discovered that
                           <a href="https://www.dji.com/nl"> DJI's </a> website appears to be 
                            well-designed, organised, and easy to navigate. The navigation bar
                             makes it simple to locate the information they seek.

                    While talking about  Design with the User in Mind
                    As I previously stated, <a href="https://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a>  played a critical role in user-centered design, which always reflected on psychological aspects of users.
                    They included a maximum of seven navigation options, as well as a hamburger menu where users can easily find the information they need.

                    <p><span>Principle of Identity: </span>When it comes to knowing a brand or
                         a company solely based on their logo, Apple Inc. has played the most 
                         important role in this regard. Regardless of age or gender, almost 
                         anyone can recognize an Apple product by its logo. Apple is one of 
                         the best examples of identity principles.

                    <p><span>Focus, Attention & Concentration: </span>
                    Google Maps was extremely helpful in terms of the Principles of Focus,
                     Attention, and Concentration. And they strive to improve their user 
                     experience every year. Google has become one of the most well-known 
                     and respected technology companies in the world as a result of their
                      increased concern for their users. Google Maps provides real-time 
                      directions and indicators. If a user attempts to travel somewhere, 
                      Google Maps provides precise information in terms of station numbers, 
                      platform numbers, and current location. This made their applications 
                      more user-friendly than any other application that provides the same 
                      service.</p>

                <div class="mistakes">
                    <p><span>Principle of Mistakes: </span>It is obvious that human error occurs frequently, but allowing the user to identify and understand the problem and making it simple can improve overall user performance and experience on any website.
The                     Facebook log in section is a good example of UX Mistake Principles.

                    <p><span>Emotional Contagion: </span> People frequently refuse to believe in something in the first place if they do not see any proof or statement from others about it. For example, when choosing a good place to eat, people frequently rely on other people's reviews and comments about a particular restaurant's food and services. In this manner, a website can gain the trust of its users as well as potential customers.
                    In terms of Principles of Emotional Contagion, Google Maps did an excellent job.
                    Anyone can easily search anything and find reviews left by people who have used the services.

                <div class="socialization">
                    <p><span>Principle of Socialization: </span> People frequently follow their favorite websites on social media, especially if they rely on their services. For example, the Dutch Railways' NS portal offers the best service to their customers in terms of purchasing tickets and searching for train schedules.
                    The platform has a lot of information to look through, which can take time away
                     from certain users who are looking for specific information. However, their 
                     portal encourages users to contact their social platform, where users can ask 
                     and receive answers to their questions most of the time in a very short period
                      of time. Allowing users to connect with social media can improve the user
                       experience of certain platforms.</p>

                         lot of aspects how to design and create interfaces that are visually 
                         appealing, easy to use, and emotionally engaging for users.
                         This helped me to Understand how users perceive, interpret, allocate 
                         their attention, remember, feel. Also understanding what motivates them 
                         can help me design interfaces that encourage engagement, interaction, 
                         and user satisfaction.</p>
